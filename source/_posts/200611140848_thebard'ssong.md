> The bards and their songs

> When hours have gone by

> In a world far away

> Tomorrow will take us away

> Far from home
>
> No one will ever know our names

> Tomorrow will take it away

> The fear of today

> It will be gone

> Tales of a brave man

> And You're not alone
>
> So don't be afraid
>
> In the dark and cold
>
> 'Cause the bards' songs will remain
>
> They all will remain
>
> In my thoughts and in my dreams
>
> They're always in my mind
>
> These songs of hobbits, dwarves and men
>
> And elves
>
> Come close Your eyes
>
> You can see them, too

这歌是从Shane那舶来的，已经在我电脑和mp3中潜伏很久了，也听了好多遍，不过复习操作系统头痛的时候又翻出来听到，觉得有点特别的感觉，就搜到了歌词，本来想译一遍的，不过现在想去睡了，等有心情时再弄吧。

先不评价了，贴个链接上来，有兴趣的可以去听听
